Capistrano's configuration is managed through a set of magic variables. Some only take effect under certain circumstances, and others will affect all operations.

Please see the table below for more information:

| Variable name       | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| `:application`      | Arbitrary variable, useful to store your application name within. |
| `:deploy_to`        | The path on the servers we're going to be deploying the application to. For example `/var/www/my-application`. The default is `/u/apps/`. |
| `:default_environment` | A hash that can be used to set environment variables that should be present for all commands that are executed, e.g. ```ruby
  set :default_environment, {
    'PATH' => '/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin',
    'TERM' => 'dumb',
  }
  ``` |
| `:gateway`          | Define a gateway server. All subsequent connections will be tunneled through the gateway (using SSH forwarded ports). |
| `:keep_releases` | The number of old releases to keep, defaults to 5, can be overridden with any positive integer, negative values will produce undefined behaviour. 0 means zero. *The deploy:cleanup task is not run in the [Default Deployment Behaviour](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/2.x-Default-Deployment-Behaviour), so you must run it manually or add it to your recipe.* |
| `:local_repository` | The repository URL that should be used when querying from your workstation. If this is set, `:repository`, becomes the URL that should be used when querying the repository from the remote hosts. *This is handy when you are accessing the repository via different methods locally vs. remotely:*
```ruby
  set :repository,        "file:///var/svn/repos/my_app"
  set :local_repository,  "svn+ssh://#{user}@servername.com/var/svn/repos/my_app"
```
|
| `:migrate_env`   | The environment in which to run Rails migrations, this has no default, and is thus the default of `rake db:migrate`. |
| `:password`         | The SSH password you are logging into the server(s) with. It should be the password that matches the :user variable. It is generally not a good idea to hard-code this variable into the file, except while you are first getting familiar with Capistrano. It is much better idea to setup SSH public/private keys - in which case this variable does not need to be set at all. Again [[Using SSH Keys]] is recommended. |
| `:rake`          | The full path to [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org) on your system. Defaults to `rake`; e.g. the current directory. |
| `:repository`       | The URL of the repository that hosts our code, for example `http://github.com/capistrano/capistrano.git` or `git@github.com/capistrano/capistrano.git`. If you are hosting the repository on your own. |
| `:scm`              | For specifying the type of source control system you are using. It is set to `git` by default. It is unnecessary to set it explicitly unless you are using something else. See the [[Source Control]] section for more info. |
| `:scm_username`     | The username that your [[Source Control]] system will use to access the repository. |
| `:scm_password`     | The password that your source control system (for ex: subversion) will use to access the repository. It is generally not a good idea to hard-code this variable into the file, except while you are first getting familiar with Capistrano. It is a better idea to investigate [[Using SSH Keys]]. Where [[Using SSH Keys]] is not an option [[SCM Credential Caching]] might be appropriate. |
| `:use_sudo`         | Defines for the *default* Rails deployment recipes whether we want to use `sudo` or not. `sudo` is a unix tool for executing commands as the [root user](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_user). To use it, your user must have *password-less* `sudo` access enabled. If you're using shared hosting where `sudo` access may not be enabled for your user, you should set `:use_sudo` to false. *In general, if you can get away without using `sudo`, you should avoid it*. For example, 37signals now uses a system where they have a special deployment user, and always deploy as that user. |
| `:user`             | The SSH username you are logging into the server(s) as. In collaborative development, you might not want to embed your own username here, since other developers might be deploying, too. [[Using SSH Keys]] is recommended. |
